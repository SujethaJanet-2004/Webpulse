Day 1 – Project Initialization

Date: 11 Nov 2025
Focus: Setting up the foundation for the project.

✅ What I Did Today:

Created a main project folder called webpuls on my desktop.

Inside it, added subfolders: frontend, backend, scrapper, and docs.

Initialized a GitHub repository and connected it to my local folder.

Added .gitignore and README.md files for professional setup.

Made my first commit and successfully pushed to GitHub.

🧠 What I Learned:

How to set up a proper full-stack project structure.

The importance of .gitignore (to keep repos clean).

How Git connects local folders to remote repositories.

That setting up correctly once saves massive time later.

⚡ Thoughts / Challenges:

Initially felt confused about all the folders and Git commands,
but once I did them manually, I started understanding how developers organize their work.
