Day 1 – Project Initialization
Date: 11 Nov 2025
Focus: Setting up the foundation for the project.

✅ What I Did Today:

- Created a main project folder called webpuls on my desktop.
- Inside it, added subfolders: frontend, backend, scrapper, and docs.
- Initialized a GitHub repository and connected it to my local folder.
- Added .gitignore and README.md files for professional setup.
- Made my first commit and successfully pushed to GitHub.

🧠 What I Learned:

- How to set up a proper full-stack project structure.
- The importance of .gitignore (to keep repos clean).
- How Git connects local folders to remote repositories.
- That setting up correctly once saves massive time later.
